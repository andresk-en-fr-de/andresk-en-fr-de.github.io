# 🌍 Andre's GitHub Portfolio Site

This is my personal IT skills portfolio website, AI-assisted and built from scratch with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, and hosted on **GitHub Pages**.

The site introduces me and showcases projects I’ve built using and traditional front-end technologies with help/advice and sometimes insturctions and generations from AI. It also includes a simple JavaScript feature that dynamically changes the greeting in multiple languages (EN/DE/FR/SK) — reflecting both my multilingual background and growing dev skills.

## 📝 About me
I'm a self-taught web developer with a background in language teaching, translation, and digital marketing. I speak English, French, German, and Slovak — and I can build websites and simple front-end apps using **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and AI tools** like ChatGPT and DALL·E. I'm currently exploring freelance or creative tech work in Slovakia, Czech Republic and the DACH region.

### 🗺️ Beyond the Code

I’m an avid runner 🏃‍♂️, and while running, I often get lost in thoughts about history — especially the French Revolution 🇫🇷 — or places I’ve been 🌍 (New york, Paris, Peru, Dubai) and places I still still dream of seeing(Switzerland, the Caribbean....) Sometimes I get more lost in those visions than in JavaScript loops 🌀. I guess my mind runs further than my legs sometimes.
